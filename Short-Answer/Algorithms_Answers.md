#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

It's o(n) because with each additional increase in n, the number of operations increases proportionally to n. This can be clearly seen in helper file code.py, in which the algorithm is tested for different values of n. With each 1 increase in the value of n, the algorithm performs 1 additional operation.

b)



c)
